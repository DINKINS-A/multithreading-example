A clothing company is building a new store. They want to determine the optimum (but fixed) number of dressing rooms they should install in this location.

In your assessment as a software consultant, you will create a simulation of the clothing store using the C# programming language. By running a software model, you will be able to examine different scenarios to determine the optimal configuration of the store and appropriate number of dressing rooms.

You must create a scenario in which a group of customers will be waiting to use the dressing rooms.

Each customer may take up to six clothing items into a dressing room.

Each item of clothing is estimated to take one to three minutes to try on.

Once the customer has attempted to fit into each of the items, the customer will leave the dressing room.

Leaving the dressing room makes the room available for another customer.

In each scenario, use variables to determine the number of customers and dressing rooms.

Use a random number function to determine the number of items for each customer.
